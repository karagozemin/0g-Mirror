## What this proof shows

- A Decision Trace JSON payload was uploaded to 0G Storage (see the storage tx).
- The trace root / content-addressed URI and decision hash were registered on 0G Chain (register tx).
- The replay verifier recomputed the expected outcome from the public evidence and the on-chain status was updated to `Verified` (verification tx).
- The downloaded trace matches the recorded `decisionHash`.

## What this proof does not claim

- It does not reveal or store private model chain-of-thought.
- It does not assert production-grade oracle security.
- It does not claim fully decentralized verifiable-compute in the current MVP.

Note: the current MVP uses deterministic replay verification and is designed to plug into 0G Compute for verifiable execution in future work.

## How to reproduce (high level)

1. Install dependencies.
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and populate 0G Chain / Storage and key values.
3. Run `npm run proof:real`.
4. Confirm `proofs/real-0g-proof.json` matches the table above.

## How to Verify the Storage Proof

1. Use the `0g://` URI or root from the proof table.
2. Download the stored JSON using the repository's 0G Storage helper or the SDK.
3. Confirm that `hashes.decisionHash` equals the Decision Hash in the table.
4. Confirm that the downloaded payload matches `proofs/downloaded-real-trace.json` (or the canonical stored payload).

## How to Verify the Chain Proof

1. Inspect `MirrorRegistry` at the deployed address from the proof table.
2. Read the stored record for `traceId = 1`.
3. Confirm the stored `traceURI`, `traceRoot`, and `decisionHash` match the proof table.
4. Confirm the on-chain `status` is `Verified`.
5. Match the registration and verification transaction hashes with those in the proof table.

## Reproduce the Proof

Run:

```bash
npm run proof:real
```

This command builds a deterministic Decision Trace, uploads it to 0G Storage, registers the trace on 0G Chain, runs replay verification to update status, downloads the trace back, and writes the resulting artifact to `proofs/real-0g-proof.json`.

## Verification pointers

- Storage: use the 0g:// URI to download the JSON and confirm `hashes.decisionHash` matches the Decision Hash above.
- Chain: inspect `MirrorRegistry` at the deployed address and confirm the stored `traceURI`, `traceRoot`, and `status`.
